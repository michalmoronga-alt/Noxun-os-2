# NOXUN OS 2.0 Vision

Describe the purpose and boundaries of the NOXUN OS 2.0 system here.

- It is an internal tool for managing custom furniture production workflows.
- It keeps a single source of truth about orders, process steps, tasks, agreements, and purchase orders.
- It links to external files on Google Drive but does not store them.
- It is not a CRM or an accounting system.
