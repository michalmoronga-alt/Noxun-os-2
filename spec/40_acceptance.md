# NOXUN OS 2.0 Acceptance Scenarios

List real scenarios that must work correctly. For example:

1. When a new order is created, a default process template is cloned and active step status derives order status.
2. Changing the status of tasks on a step automatically marks the step done when all tasks are complete.
3. Adding a purchase order links it to the order and displays on the order detail.
4. Adding an agreement logs the approver and does not require date range.
5. Drive links open the correct folder or file when clicked.
